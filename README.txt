Commands:
 - MousePicking: left mouse Button
	Notes: 
	1) You can drag legos inside the designed grid space (36x10x36).
	2) Your mousePicking works by "Y-Planes" (for ex. you can only grab Legos on the floor (Y-plane = 0), but you can press "W" and "S" to traverse planes up and down).
	3) You can grab a Lego in one plane and move it to other plane by holding the Lego and pressing "W" or "S".
	4) The lego you pick is highlighted lightly.
 - Grouping Legos: "G"
	Notes: 
	1) There are some unsolved problems with grouping. The idea was moving multiple legos simultaneously... we are able to join them in a group but moving them was a barrier for our group.
	2) You can join a few legos but they don't move together as intended.
 - Ungrouping Legos: "U"
	Notes:
	1) Works fine.
	2) Ungroups the last lego you picked with its group, if it has any.
	3) If you remove a lego from a group formed by 2 legos, then that group is destroyed.
	
 - Saving the current scene (in a text file): "P"
	1) Your scene is saved into "nono.txt"
	2) The program always read that text file on start.
